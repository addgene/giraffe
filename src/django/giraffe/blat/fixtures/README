How to generate fixtures?
-------------------------

DO NOT DO THIS IF YOU ALREADY HAVE SEQUENCE STORED. There are FK
references from your sequence data to data in models that may become
inconsistent if you replace data in the models.

List of features to be detected are stored in ./features/.

mk_db.sh groups features into feature databases.

If you make changes to files in ./features/ or to mk_db.sh, you should
re-create the fixtures for this app to make the changes visible. To do
so, on a test machine, 

1. Blow away data in all the models in the "blat" application

2. Load feature_types.json

3. Run mk_db.sh

4. In ../.., run "python manage.py dumpdata blat" to create a new
initial_data.json, and move that file to this directory.

After that, anytime you run syncdb, the new fixture will be loaded.
